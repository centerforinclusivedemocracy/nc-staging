            <h1>About The Tool</h1>

            <p>
                The North Carolina Voting Location Siting Tool aids election officials in the siting process by identifying optimal voting locations for half-mile grid squares across a county. Election officials are able to find specific locations for consideration in these areas using local knowledge of their county’s resources and needs. The Siting Tool also provides visualization of demographic and voter data at the community level in each of the state’s 54 most populous counties.
            </p>
            <p>
                Note: The Tool sites the legally required number of voting locations in a county as a minimum baseline. The Siting Tool’s purpose is to model the location of voting sites, not to suggest what number of voting locations best serves a community.
